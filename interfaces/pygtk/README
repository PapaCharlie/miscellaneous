This interface demonstrates communicating with a sample liq client to 
make requests. This demo is a wip and will form the framework for major changes in rocket.

The key features of this demo is it's use of the pygtk threading as demonstrated on http://www.johnstowers.co.nz,
with the goal within rocket to have a multithreading manager for communicating with the liq daemon.

You'll first need to create a suitable client (ie liq.py) and then run the client (client.py), you will
require two terminals for this.

Ie:

python liq.py - In the first terminal
python client.py - In the second terminal

Within the client you can:
*) See what's in the queue
*) Set the player on CUE or PLAY
*) Insert new tracks into the queue
