\section{Liquid Flows}
We maintain a \href{http://savonet.sourceforge.net/flows.html}{webpage of streams generated by
Liquidsoap}, that we like to call
\emph{Liquidsoap Flows}. In order to register your radio on this page, a simple
operator called \verb+register_flow+ is provided. If your stream is called \verb+stream+,
you can register it with

\begin{verbatim}
stream = register_flow(
  radio="My radio",
  website="http://my.web.site/",
  description="The sound of my computer",
  genre="reggae",
  streams=[("mp3/128k","http://my.web.site/stream")],
  stream)
\end{verbatim}
All the parameters should be pretty explicit: \verb+radio+ is the name of the radio,
\verb+website+ is the url of the website of the radio, etc. The only subtle parameter
is \verb+streams+: it is a list of pairs of strings describing the format of the
stream and the url of the stream (we use a list here because one radio can be
broadcasted under multiple stream formats). The format should always be of the
form \verb+codec/bitrate+ (e.g. \verb+mp3/128k+) or \verb+codec+ if it is encoded in variable
bitrate.
