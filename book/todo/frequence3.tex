\section{Fréquence 3}
\href{http://www.frequence3.fr}{Fréquence 3} uses Liquidsoap mainly on the backstage,
for different purposes:

\begin{itemize}
\item transcoding for different formats (OGG, weird MP3 relays...)
\item scheduling and playlist for audio backup streams, and test streams
\item blank detection

\end{itemize}
They look forward to using Liquidsoap even more, and work with the Savonet team
to make sure this tool can ease the work of webradios :)

They provide an MP3 stream \href{http://streams.frequence3.net/mp3-128.m3u}{here}.
